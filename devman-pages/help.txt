DEVMAN HELP

devman: a basic cli tool for development man pages

usage:
	devman <TOPIC>/<PAGE>

	TOPIC  The topic (or language) that devman should search in.
	PAGE   The exact man page that devman should open

EXAMPLE
	To get the devman page on devman itself, both topic and page should be 'devman':

	devman devman/devman

	To lookup a function in the python language, use this syntax:

	devman python/<FUNCTION NAME>

	where <FUNCTION NAME> is the name of the thing you want to lookup.

ERRORS
	devman is not yet fully developed, and therefore may be missing many important pages. Because of this, many pages may not yet exist.
	If you can, please contribute to devman. See 'contribute' under 'devman':

	devman devman/contribute

CONTROLS
	devman's controls are very simple:
	
	use the arrow keys for navigation (up and down)
	to leave, press 'q'
